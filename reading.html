            <h2>The Innovators</h2>
            <h3>Walter Isaacson</h3>
            <p>A fun, thorough history of the digital revolution. Goes to show that what we usually refer to as "innovation" is, more often than not, the result of collaboration, proliferation of ideas, and merging of the arts and sciences. Walter Isaacson books are awesome!</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
            <h3>Walter Isaacson</h3>
            <p>This book is just absolutely amazing. I almost cried at the end of this one. Steve Jobs was not a perfect person by any stretch of the imagination, but I think there is much to be learned from both his failures and his successes. His ability to fuse the arts and sciences and to inspire others with his creative vision were unmatched for his time. "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - Steve Jobs</p>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Outliers</h2>
            <h3>Malcolm Galdwell</h3>
            <p>This one is a collection of stories and analyses on what drives success and how our cultural backgrounds really do play an important role in shaping who we are and how we operate as individuals. Malcolm Gladwell has a really unique perspective on the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!"</h2>
            <h3>Richard Feynman</h3>
            <p>This is a collection of anecdotes from his life. Feynman was the embodiment of goofy, mischievous genius. Hilarious and entertaining.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>"What Do You Care What Other People Think?"</h2>
            <h3>Richard Feynman</h3>
            <p>The sequel to "Surely Your Joking Mr. Feynman". I find it just as entertaining as the first one.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track</h2>
            <h3>Richard Feynman</h3>
            <p>A collection of letters sent from and recieved by Feynman over the course of his life. Provides more insight about the kind of person he was. Another great Feynman read.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Meditations</h2>
            <h3>Marcus Aurelius</h3>
            <p>An awesome guide to living the good life. Couldn't recommend this enough. Marcus Aurelius was one noble dude.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Anthem</h2>
            <h3>Ayn Rand</h3>
            <p>A great story about the importance of individuality and the dangers of collectivism.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Be Here Now</h2>
            <h3>Baba Ram Dass</h3>
            <p>I heard about this from the Steve Jobs biography. This book is incredible and has forever changed my perception of reality. "You're standing on a bridge watching yourself go by" - Baba Ram Dass</p>
